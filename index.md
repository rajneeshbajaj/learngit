## Welcome to learn git in 15 mins

These set of exercises will help you get started with git very quickly and prepare you to contribute to any project.

You can use [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) to install all the dependencies on your system.
We will use command prompt to learn about the most used commands.

### Installing Git

If you want to download it yourself. You will find all the information required at [GitDownloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads),

### Hands on exercises for a beginner
#### Exercise 1 : Get the branch (master) 
```markdown
Theory : git clone command gets the source to your current directory.

git clone https://github.com/rajneeshbajaj/learngit
```
#### Exercise 2 : Create a branch from master
```markdown
Theory : git branch BRANCH-NAME command create the branch
         git checkout BRANCH-NAME makes branch active in your current directory.
         Any changes you make will be committed to the branch.
         
git branch rajb1
git checkout rajb1

OR the shorter version

git checkout -b rajb1
```
#### Exercise 3 : Make changes to a file.
In the [src](https://github.com/rajneeshbajaj/learngit/tree/main/src) folder, 
modify helloword.py on your machine to have print('Hello World') in the second line.
